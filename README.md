# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assignments

## Contents of the repository -

This repository contains a notebook used to analyse the Anscombe Quartet Dataset for the purpose of this assignmnet.
The original paper produced by Francis Anscombe can be viewed [here](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf). While further information relating to the dataset can be viewed in the notebook within the repository or [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet#Data)


The four main objectives of this analysis were to complete the following - 

1. Explain the background to the dataset â€“ who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.

2. Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.

3. Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.

4. Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above

To meet the above objectives the notebook contains both descriptive statistics and visualisations using various python packages to print the results in the notebook required.

## How to run the notebook -

The notebook produced contains both code and text fields in order to highlight the points required and produce the statistics and visualisations required to meet the objectives.
Due to this each box can be run using the Shift and Enter shortcut for Jupyter Notebooks. This will produce and formatted text in the markdown fields and produce the calculations or visualisations where code is present.
Each of these fields in turn will be discussed and explained throughout the notebook with more information provided later in the summary section.
