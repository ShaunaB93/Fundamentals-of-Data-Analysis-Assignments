# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assignments

## Contents of the repository -

This repository contains a notebook used to analyse the Anscombe Quartet Dataset for the purpose of this assignmnet.
The original paper produced by Francis Anscombe can be viewed [here](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/anscombe1973.pdf). While further information relating to the dataset can be viewed in the notebook within the repository or [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet#Data) *[2]*

The four main objectives of this analysis were to complete the following - 

1. Explain the background to the dataset â€“ who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.

2. Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.

3. Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.

4. Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above

To meet the above objectives the notebook contains both descriptive statistics and visualisations using various python packages to print the results in the notebook required.

## How to run the notebook -

To run, edit and view this notebook the download option can be used on the dashboard view for this repository. This will download a zip file containing the various Notebooks and files for this assignment. The completed assignment for all details matching the brief above has been named - *"Notebook for analysing the Anscombe Quartet Dataset"*.

In order to use this notebook it is required to have the correct packages installed which allow jupyter notebook to be utilised on the machine being used to view this file. The most popular way to install this, and multiple other useful packages, is through the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). *[3]*

Once the relevant file has been downloaded locally to your machine, and you have installed the packages required to utilise jupyter notebooks, the command jupyter notebook can be ran through any command line interface which you may have installed. This can be ran from your home folder or by using the "cd" command to the folder in which you have downloaded the notebooks files. This will lead to a pop up window of Jupyter notebook to be opened and a list of files in the folder you have ran this command from should appear. Following this you will need to locate the*"Notebook for analysing the Anscombe Quartet Dataset"* file on your machine using the file structure in Jupyter notebook.

Once the file has been opened the Cell, run all, commands can be used to re-run any code cells to view the results etc. The various functions which can be used in the jupyter notebooks to view, edit and run the cells, text or code, can be found on their website [here](http://jupyter.org/) or through the various cheat sheets available online. *[4]*
